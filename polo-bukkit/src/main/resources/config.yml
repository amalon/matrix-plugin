# Whether to relay Minecraft player joins, quits & kicks to Matrix.
# If this is set to true, fake Matrix users will:
#  - join the Matrix room when the player connects to the Minecraft server.
#  - leave the Matrix room when the player quits from the Minecraft server.
#  - get kicked from the Matrix room by the _mc_bot user when the player is
#    kicked from the Minecraft server (make sure that the _mc_bot has
#    sufficient privileges to kick users).
# If this is set to false, fake Matrix users will join the room only to relay
# chat messages from players, and won't leave by themselves.
